<h1>When did slavery begin</h1>
<p>In late August, 1619, 20-30 enslaved Africans 
    landed at Point Comfort, today's Fort Monroe 
    in Hampton, Va., aboard the English privateer 
    ship White Lion. In Virginia, these Africans 
    were traded in exchange for supplies. 
    Several days later, a second ship (Treasurer) 
    arrived in Virginia with additional enslaved
     Africans.</p>
