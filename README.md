• The Sign Up Form
- The sign up section has a form to collect information from parents to sign their children up to a cycling class and for safe guarding issues we don't allow anyone to directly sign up for a class immediately, instead we tell users that our team will reach out to them with further details.
- The sign up form is also for those who are 18+ to fill out, in this case they still cant sign up immideiately, a member of our team will reach out to confirm their age
- The sign up form collects the name, last name, email and phone number.
- The sign up form is valuable to users because it ensures they will be reached out to and they are half-way there in confirming a secure spot in one of our cycle classes.
