• The Sign Up Form
- The sign up section has a form to collect information from parents to sign their children up to a cycling class and for safe guarding issues we don't allow anyone to directly sign up for a class immediately, instead we tell users that our team will reach out to them with further details
- The sign up form is also for those who are 18+ to fill out, in this case they still cant sign up immideiately, a member of our team will reach out to confirm their age
- The sign up form collects the name, last name, email and phone number.
- The sign up form is valuable to users because it ensures they will be reached out to and they are half-way there in confirming a secure spot in one of our cycle classes.

_ I confirm that the project is responsive, looks cohesive and functions on all standard screen sizes using 
the dev tools device bar.
- I confirm that the navigatiion, header, about us, sign up/contact text are all reliable and 
easy to read.
- I have confirmed that the form works, the form works and requires entries in every field, will only accpet a
email in the email field and the submit button works.

BUGS

Release History
We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

September 1 2021: Remove PGHOSTADDR environment variable.

July 19 2021: Remove font_fix script now that the terminal font issue is fixed.

July 2 2021: Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX.

June 30 2021: Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file.

June 10 2021: Added: font_fix script and alias to fix the Terminal font issue

May 10 2021: Added heroku_config script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

April 7 2021: Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

October 21 2020: Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

October 08 2020: Additional large Gitpod files (core.mongo* and core.python*) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the .gitignore by default.

September 22 2020: Gitpod occasionally creates large core.Microsoft files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A .gitignore file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

April 16 2020: The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

April 13 2020: Added the Prettier code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

February 2020: The initialisation files now do not auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
December 2019: Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type !bscdn in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the README.md file at the official repo for more options.

FAQ about the uptime script
Why have you added this script?

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

How will this affect me?

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
The current date and time
The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.
It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

So….?

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

Can I opt out?

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
Anything more?

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the uptime.sh file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

Happy coding!
